#Instructions 
Run the makefile to compile the binary that is loaded in the python class. The 
python class Word2Vec looks for that binary called "word2vec.so" in the same folder. 
It also requires a file with the pre-trained vectors that is provided by google such 
as the news groups vectors. Just pass the constructor the  path to the pre-trained
vectors file and call the class methods from python.
